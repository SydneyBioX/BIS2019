# Introduction to Linux

This one-hour workshop, first presented at Charles Perkins Cetnre in 2019, guides users through the basics of Linux. This includes

* Connecting to a server
* Listing directory contents and changing directories
* Compressed files and pipes
* Viewing resource usage
* Searching files with grep
* Opening BAM files with SAMtools

Three data files of the GM12878 generated by ENCODE Consortium are used to give this workshop a bioinformatics style.
